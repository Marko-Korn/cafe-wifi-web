# Cafe-Wifi-Web
A website of coffee places made in Python using Flask, Bootstrap and SQLAlchemy. We also created an API that serves data on coffee.
The main purpose of this project was to get more comfortable with using SQLAlchemy and creating an API.

# Main page
A simple and minimalistic look for the main page of the website.

# API Documentation
Here is the API documentation made using Postman. Every possible request that can be made is documented here. Changes made get updated in the database and updated on the website.
